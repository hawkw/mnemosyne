# Mnemosyne
A systems programming language with compile-time memory management.

This repository contains `mnemosyne`, the Mnemosyne compiler implemented as a library, and Manganese (`mn`), a command-line application for compiling Mnemosyne programs. These codebases are separated so that the Mnemosyne compiler can be embedded in other applications.
