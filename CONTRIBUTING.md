Contributing to Mnemosyne
=========================

Contributing Code
-----------------

Basically, please don't. While Mnemosyne is free and open-source software, it is also currently being developed as part of my [senior thesis research](https://github.com/hawkw/senior-thesis). Therefore, for academic integrity reasons, I cannot currently accept code from the community until my senior thesis has been completed. However, Mnemosyne is open-source, and ou are welcome to fork, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the MIT license. Once my senior thesis has been submitted at the end of the 2015-2016 academic year, enhancements and bug fixes from the community will be happily accepted.

Bug Reports & Feature Requests
------------------------------

If you have found any bugs in Mnemosyne or would like to request a feature or improvement, please feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hawkw/mnemosyne/issues). If you are reporting a bug, please provide a complete and detailed description of the issue, a description of the environment on which Mnemosyne is running (i.e. your operating system version, computer architecture, Mnemosyne version, and any relevant stack traces or error logs). This will assist the maintainers in diagnosing and fixing the issue.

Since the language is still in very early stages of its development, feedback from the community is highly sought after and can have significant influence on how Mnemosyne grows and evolves. However, while I'm always happy to add additional features to Mnemosyne, I'm currently quite busy implementing the core language feature set, and requested features may not be added right away. 

Before opening an issue, please ensure that there is not already an open issue for the problem or feature in question. If there is an open issue already, you may wish to confirm that bug. If you do so, please include a detailed bug report, as discussed above.
